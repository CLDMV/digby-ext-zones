/**
 * Settings schema for @cldmv/digby-ext-zones. The canonical declaration of every
 * user-controllable + cross-extension-readable setting this extension
 * exposes. Read by the slothlet leaves at src/api/zones/settings/*.mjs
 * (which wrap protectedGet/Set/List) and by the host's settings UI.
 *
 * Access policies per key:
 *   omitted / "public"   — any caller reads + writes (default)
 *   "readable"           — any caller reads, only the owner writes
 *   "private"            — only the owner reads + writes
 *   { read, write }      — per-axis booleans or allowlists
 *
 * Defaults live HERE — not as DB rows. A never-set setting returns its
 * declared default at read time. Resetting deletes the row; next read
 * returns the default again.
 *
 * Mirror each entry into manifest.contributes.settings (the VIEW leaf,
 * src/view/zones/zones.mjs) for back-compat with the legacy
 * settings-pages UI until it switches to reading from the slothlet leaves.

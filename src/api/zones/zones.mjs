/*
 * @cldmv/digby-ext-zones — the NODE half's root leaf. The ext-host mounts this package's
 * src/api tree at ext.<app>.zones (filename-matches-folder flatten:
 * this file's exports land on the mount root). Sibling leaves reach each other
 * through slothlet's `self` — never by raw import (a raw import is a SECOND
 * module instance outside composition).
 *
 * Storage: this scaffold wires the storage tiers. If you don't need
 * persistence, delete sql/ and the setupSettings call below — the
 * extension still works without them.
